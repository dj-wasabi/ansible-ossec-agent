Requirements
------------

This role will work on:
 * Red Hat
 * Ubuntu
 * Debian

So, you'll need one of those operating systems.. :-)

Role Variables
--------------

This role needs 4 parameters:
* `ossec_server_ip`: This is the ip address of the server running the ossec-server.
* `ossec_server_fqdn`: This is the fqdn of the server running the ossec-server.
* `ossec_server_name`: This is the hostname of the server running the ossec-server used for delegate with ansible.
* `ossec_managed_server`: When set to false, tasks that delegate to ossec server will be skipped

This role has 3 tasks with 'delagation_to' which needs the parameter `ossec_server_name`. When this parameter is not set, you'll need to run manually the `/var/ossec/bin/ossec-authd` on the server and `/var/ossec/bin/agent-auth` on the agent. When this is the case, it will show you an message with the exact command line.

The following role variables are optional:
* `ossec_active_response_disabled`: Disables active response if set to yes. If this is not defined active response is enabled.
* `ossec_disable_public_repos`: Disables installation of public repositories if set to "yes".
* `ossec_agent_package_name`: Default is "ossec-hids-agent". This can be set to a URL or path to a .rpm file or path to a .deb file if the public repositories cannot be used.
* `ossec_agent_name`: Optional name for the OSSEC agent.  Default is to use hostname.
